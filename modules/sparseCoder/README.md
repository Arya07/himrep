## Installation

### Dependencies

This module needs the [SiftGPU](https://github.com/pitzer/SiftGPU) library. Since instructions on how to compile the library are platform-dependent, we do not provide intallation support here. However, if you need assistance, do not hesitate to ask by creating a dedicated issue.

### Compilation

Once the library has been built as explained above, you can compile this module just by setting the `BUILD_sparseCoder` flag to `ON` as explained [here](https://www.github.com/robotology/himrep#compilation).
